# springEssentials

Create a small CRUD applications using some Spring technologies, as follows:

What should this application do?
- It should be as minimal as possible, doing only what is necessary for demonstration purposes.
- It should be composed by a single set of CRUD operations, you define what entity will be represented.

What do we expect to see in this assignment?
- You should use Lombok, wisely.
- You should follow good code standards for Java and Spring applications.
- The application must be secured and require Basic authentication.
- The application must run in a dockerized environment, using a docker-compose.yml file for bootstrapping.
- The application must be connected to a database, running on a separate Docker container.
- The application should log the interaction it receives via its endpoints.
- You should write unit and integration tests for the application. Unit and Integration Tests must be implemented in separate modules.
